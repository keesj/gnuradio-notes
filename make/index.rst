3d drawing
* FreeCAD is pretty good
* OpenSCAD is pretty good

from 
-Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design tools (e.g. KiCad and gEDA)

- Analogue and digital simulators (e.g. ngspice, Qucs, Gnucap, Xyce,
GHDL, Icarus and Verilator)

- Any other EDA tools such as high-level tools for digital hardware
design (e.g. Migen) and HDL synthesis tools (e.g. Yosys)

- Field solvers such as openEMS

- Mechanical 2D and 3D CAD tools such as LibreCAD, FreeCAD, OpenSCAD and
SolveSpace

- Open Hardware projects such as the Teres laptop and the lowRISC SoC
